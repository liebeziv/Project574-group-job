issue 1: Nutritional Value Table Calculation Inaccuracy Due to Rounding
Problem Identified:
The nutritional value tables were displaying inaccurate total values due to premature rounding. The root cause was in `src/utils/numbers.ts` where the `numberUnitLocale` function had `maximumFractionDigits: 0`, which forced all nutritional values to be rounded to integers before calculations. This caused the sum totals to be mathematically incorrect when individual ingredients had fractional nutritional values.
Root Cause Analysis:
1. The `numberGramLocale` function called `numberUnitLocale` with hardcoded `maximumFractionDigits: 0`. This configuration forced all nutritional values to be displayed as integers (rounded to whole numbers), while the actual calculations were performed using the precise stored values.
2. The nutritional data is actually stored with 3 decimal places precision in the database.
Solution:
Instead of fixing the rounding issue by simply allowing decimals everywhere, I implemented a user-controlled precision toggle feature that provides:
1. Users can choose between integer display  or one decimal display
2. When precision is enabled, both individual values and totals show the same level of detail
3. Maintains clean integer display as default while offering precision when needed
Implementation Details:
Phase 1: Fix Number Display Function
Changed the numberGramLocale function in src/utils/numbers.ts to accept a precision setting. Removed the hardcoded maximumFractionDigits: 0 and created a new numberConfigurable function to show decimal places when needed.
Phase 2: Add Toggle to Tables
Added precision toggle buttons to nutrition value tables. Used React's useState to control whether to show whole numbers or decimals. Added simple toggle buttons with icons and help text.
Phase 3: Create Global Settings
Built a global system using React Context to save precision settings across the whole app. Added localStorage to remember user choices between browser sessions.
Phase 4: Connect All Components
Updated all nutrition tables to use the global precision setting instead of their own local settings. Used useNutritionPrecision hook to share the same precision choice everywhere.
Phase 5: Add Controls to Main Pages
Wrapped the React app with the precision provider and added toggle buttons to main nutrition pages. Made sure all nutrition displays use the same precision setting.
Phase 6: Create Reusable Button
Made a standard PrecisionToggleButton component that looks and works the same everywhere. Added the precision control to more places like ingredient details and improved the help text.

issue 2: Add Meal Form Time Field Not Editable
Problem Identified:
In the "Add Meal" form, the time field was not properly editable or selectable. Users couldn't modify the time when adding or editing meals, which significantly impacted the meal logging functionality.
Root Cause Analysis:
The TimePicker component in MealForm.tsx was receiving a Luxon DateTime object but the onChange handler was directly passing the Luxon DateTime object to Formik, which expects a JavaScript Date object. This type mismatch prevented proper form state updates.
Solution:
Convert the returned Luxon DateTime back to a JS Date before saving into Formik.
