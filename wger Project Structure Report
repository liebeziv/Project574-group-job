Core Features

wger offers the following main features to its users:
on dashboard user can see the workout routine, nutrition plan and Weight graph.
also, user can trach above in calender.
Customizable Workout Plans: 
create workout routines-including define what exercise,how many sets,how much weight,how many repetitions,also superset and automated progression rule.
after workout, user can record training log-date,time,notes,impression, specific exercise results(repetitions, weight, rir). log overview is provided.
user can download routine or see it in table view,create template.
user can log the measurment of whatever part of body they want, like today, arm ,26cm.
also got body weight overview where uers can add weight record and a table and graph will automaticaly show the statics.

High-Level Structure
Repository Organization
wger uses a multi-repository, single-project structure with 13 specialized repositories, where a single project is distributed across multiple specialized repositories. Each repository is responsible for a different component of the project. This structure allows developers with different technical expertise to focus on their specific areas, keeping the project modular and easy to maintain.
The project includes additional repositories for Kubernetes deployment (helm-charts), Unraid support (unraid-templates), and other specialized tools.

//Repository改成4个
Repository Identification
Main Repository: wger-project/wger
Purpose: This is the main server-side part of the project for managing workouts, nutrition plans, and body statistics.
Developer Access Reason: Backend development, API development, data model definition, and business logic implementation.
Expected Content: Python/Django code, database models, REST API endpoints, and some frontend components.

Mobile Repository: wger-project/flutter
Purpose: A mobile application written in Flutter. Let users access the wger services on their mobile devices.
Developer Access Reason:  to develop or maintain the mobile application, add new features, or fix bugs.
Expected Content: Dart/Flutter code, mobile app interface, and API client implementations.

Docker Repository: wger-project/docker
Purpose: defines how to deploy the wger application using Docker.
Developer Access Reason: test, develop, or production deployment of the application using Docker containers.
Expected Content: Docker configuration files, environment variable settings, and instructions for building and running the application.

Documentation Repository: wger-project/docs
Purpose: Project documentation.
Developer Access Reason: Writing documentation, updating API documentation, and maintaining user guides.
Expected Content: reStructuredText documents, Sphinx configuration, and technical documentation.

Data Repository: wger-project/data
Purpose: Raw and large datasets.
Developer Access Reason: Database initialization, food data management, and preparing test data.
Expected Content: JSON/SQL data files and data import scripts.

Frontend Repository: wger-project/react
Purpose: contains the React components used in the wger web interface.
Developer Access Reason: Frontend development, UI component development, and user interface optimization.
Expected Content: TypeScript/React code and frontend component libraries.

//添加官方文档引用，明确仓库间的实际交互方式
Inter-Repository Relationships
The repositories interact through well-defined API interfaces and data formats. The main repository provides REST API services, while the mobile and frontend components communicate with the backend via HTTP requests.
The Docker repository integrates all these components to form a complete application stack.
Project Architecture
Overall Architecture
wger uses a container-based architecture with six separate services. The backend is built on Django's Model-View-Template (MVT) pattern, combined with a RESTful API design, to support a variety of client applications.

Development Environment
Option 1 — Docker (recommended for most cases).
Install Docker and Docker Compose. Clone the wger-project/docker repository. Edit the .env file.
Start with docker compose up and stop with docker compose down.
Option 2 — Manual installation (for advanced customization).
Install dependencies: PostgreSQL, Node.js, Yarn, Sass. Clone the wger-project/wger repository.
Create and activate a virtualenv with python -m venv venv and source venv/bin/activate. Install dependencies with pip install -e .. Collect resources with python manage.py collectstatic. Start with python manage.py runserver.
