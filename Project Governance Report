Project Funding and Commercialization
  Primary Funding Sources
  The wger project is funded by:
  GitHub Sponsors: the project accepts donations on the GitHub Sponsors platform, currently there are 3 sponsors 
  Community Donations: the project website explicitly states that it accepts donations from the community to support server    operating costs 
  Volunteer Contributions: the project relies heavily on the time and effort input of volunteers
  The project clearly states that it is free, does not use advertising and does not sell users' personal information.
 
  Funding Transparency and Distribution
  The GitHub Sponsors page shows that donations are primarily used to:
  Pay server costs 
  Keep the project active 
  Support major new feature development
  Specific details on the distribution of funds and the amount of money were not found in the public profile.

  Commercial Independence
  The project maintains complete commercial independence:
  Uses AGPL 3+ open source licence 
  Does not depend on any commercial entity 
  Can be self-hosted, users have control of their own data 
  Provides an open REST API

  Sustainability Considerations
  Open source allows community takeover 
  Self-hosted option reduces reliance on centralised services 
  Multi-platform availability (Android, iOS, Web, etc.)
