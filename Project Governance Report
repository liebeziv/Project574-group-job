  Governance Model
  Based on contribution guide, contributors lists, and pull requests，we assumed this project use benevolent dictator model.
  Because Roland Geider, the author of wger project handle most pull request.

  Primary Leadership
  The primary founder and developer of the wger project is Roland Geider, who is listed on GitHub under the username rolandgeider and is also labelled as the project author on PyPI.Roland Geider plays a role similar to that of a Benevolent Dictator, which is a common governance model in open source projects .

  Decision making process
  The project follows a typical open source collaboration model: 
  Contributors are required to open issues for discussion before starting development of new features 
  Code reviews are conducted through GitHub's Pull Request system 
  Major decisions are made by the project maintainers, with Roland Geider as the project's founder having the final decision-making authority
  The community can participate in discussions through the Discord server and the GitHub issues
  
  Community Involvement
  The project encourages many forms of community participation: 
  Code contributions 
  Adding and translating exercise data 
  Application translation via the Weblate platform 
  Community discussions on Discord and Mastodon 
  Bug reports and feature suggestions
  

Governance Commentary
  Strengths of the Current Model
  Based on the experience of several weeks of project participation, the governance model of the wger project shows the  following strengths: 
  Community quality is high: the quality of the community discussions is very good, the participants are active and often ask all kinds of questions and needed features, creating a good feedback environment.
  New contributor friendly: New contributors can easily get started with the project, repositories are clearly differentiated, and the deployment process is straightforward. This lowers the barrier to participation and helps attract new contributors.
  Good documentation: The project documentation is very clear but not rigid, and does not stick to a fixed format, providing good guidance for developers.
  Regular large updates: The project is regularly updated with several previously mentioned and unmentioned bug fixes, demonstrating the continuous maintenance of the project.
  Reproducible ops: Containerized/scripted dev & prod flows encode the collaboration contract into automation, reducing implicit rules and hidden barriers while lowering coordination costs.

  Identified Limitations and Bottlenecks
  The following major limitations and bottlenecks have been identified through actual participation: 
  Long response time: the maintainer takes a long time to respond to issues and pull requests, 3 issues submitted by an individual have not received a response in 2-3 weeks, and pull requests made have not been responded to after 2 weeks. While the entry barrier is low, slow response times negatively affect the enthusiasm of new contributors.
  Single-point decision-making bottleneck: There seems to be only one person making key decisions, which creates a significant processing bottleneck, especially when a quick response is required. The project could slow down significantly if the maintainer is unavailable for some time.
  Lack of Formal Decision Process: There is no formal decision process for adding new features, and many decisions seem to be based on individual aesthetic criteria rather than a systematic evaluation mechanism.
  Expertise Gap: The project lacked a number of people with design experience to improve the web interface, which created limitations in terms of user experience.
  Scattered decision context: Important trade-offs often live inside individual PR threads and are hard to rediscover.

  Power Imbalances
  A clear concentration of power in the project was observed: 
  Highly centralised decision-making: Decision-making power is mainly concentrated in the hands of a few core people, and most of the time one person (Roland Geider) seems to make the final decision.
  Differences in contributors' voices: The voices of different contributors are sometimes ignored, and in particular the suggestions of new or less active contributors may not be heeded in a timely manner.
  Core group of contributors: Although it is uncertain whether there is a clear distinction between the "inner circle" and the "outer circle", it has been observed that there is a relatively stable core group of major contributors who are involved in every major update.
  Limited communication channels: The lack of an effective mechanism to balance the views and needs of different contributors may result in some valuable suggestions being ignored.


Project Funding and Commercialization
  Primary Funding Sources
  The wger project is a free and open-source fitness and nutrition manager. The project explicitly states that it will remain free, does not use advertising, and does not sell users’ personal information, making it clearly non-profit.
  Community Donations: The project accepts donations to support server operating costs.
  Funding channels include:
  GitHub Sponsors: currently 1 active and 3 past sponsors (amounts not disclosed).
  Liberapay: about €3.92 per week from 2 patrons (~€203 per year).
  Buy Me a Coffee: 6 supporters donated 18 coffees (~€90).
  Volunteer Contributions: the project relies heavily on the time and effort input of volunteers.

  Funding Transparency and Distribution
  The GitHub Sponsors page shows that donations are primarily used to:
  Pay server costs 
  Keep the project active 
  Support major new feature development
  Specific details on the distribution of funds and the amount of money were not found in the public profile.

  Commercial Independence
  The project maintains complete commercial independence:
  Uses AGPL 3+ open source licence 
  Does not depend on any commercial entity 
  Can be self-hosted, users have control of their own data 
  Provides an open REST API

  Sustainability Considerations
  Open source allows community takeover 
  Self-hosted option reduces reliance on centralised services 
  Multi-platform availability (Android, iOS, Web, etc.)
